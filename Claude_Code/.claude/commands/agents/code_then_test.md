Create a file an outline to the senior code implementer Sub agent that you want to only update the market cap for the company when it is updated in the  @src/pipelines/companies/simple_pipeline.py. please Provide necessary context, information that you have gathered so that the software engineer is able to complete the task.  please make sure that the Software engineer creates a document for the tester to notice the change and write the necessary code to update the tests associated with the change.
Now passed the testing requirements to the QA test engineer to perform the task


Looks like the simple pipeline does not have complete test written for it. Let's tell the QA test engineer sub agent to write out the complete task and test needed for the simple pipeline. Please merge the test market cap company update test into the simple pipeline test file that it creates as well.
