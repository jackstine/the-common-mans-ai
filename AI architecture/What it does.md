## Objective
- [ ] get it to open chrome, to web pages so that I can read them.


### Problems
- [ ] after writing code, it will run the program, and see what happens.  then it will try to continue doing things.
- [ ] then it will go to the next item in the `todo.md` list.
- [ ] TTY issue, because we are using bubbletea.  I think this is specific to the application though.
- [ ] it only creates research folders when using the `#research` command.
- [ ] the AI is working in multiple projects. Not one

### Changes to Problems
- [x] it did not write anything in the `learnings.md` file either.
- [x] It wrote the code in the `tick_tac_toe` folder, not `Jakes_project/tick_tac_toe`.

### Suggestions
- provide it with instructions on how to find and eliminate errors or syntax errors or compile issues in the code.
- learn how to use a mcp sever, especially one 
- see if it will take a list of urls and search them all..
- tell it to create a commit, for every todo in the todo list.
- tell it to refine the todo list, so that there are smaller sets of todos.
	- Need a way to organize, priorize, and rank the todo list, especially based off dependencies.
- triage the items in the learnings.md so that we can learn from them and create solutions for them. 
- have a `plan-todo.md` so that we can create a todo for the plan...
- get rid of it's it cant be done mentality. `doing the same things again and again` and expecting different results. needs to listen and do what I say.
- todos need to have the main objective.  This can also be in the plan as well.
- have a look at later file, a file that has a list of things I want to look at later.   
- I need to enforce it to restructure the todo list, into organized chunks. 
- I need to enforce it to digest and create smaller sized todos in the todo list.
	- maybe make it size it to
- need to restrict the usage of `go get`
- need to research persmission and controls in claude code as well.
- we need to add tools, so that it can find todos `grep "- \[ \]"`
- we need it to complete one step at a time in the `todo.md`.
- for UIs it is best to make them design it, or create an image and then have them somehow get an image produced from the code itself.
- How can I get multiple agents to work on the same project during the planning step of the application?
- ask it to create a dependency graph, based off the `plan.md` file
- before it creates the `todo.md` file make sure that it re-reads the design docs for information about the application, then reference the `plan.md` to generate the `todo.md` list.
