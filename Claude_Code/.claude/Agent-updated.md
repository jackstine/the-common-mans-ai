need to tell the qa-test-engineer that they 
- are not allowed to update non-test code
- they must analyze the code and recommend that it is complete?

- I think have a TDD development model is going to be the best way to move forward with this project though.

- We want the QA to make a mock of what should happen in the functions that it assume need to be created, and then create them.
