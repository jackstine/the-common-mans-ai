That gives me a clear picture of your experience and what you want to achieve. It's great that you want to start with a foundational\n  understanding and build from there.\n\n  Based on your goals, I've created a plan for us. The idea is to start with the fundamentals of how I interact with your project and then progressively build up\n  to a complete development task, incorporating the features you're interested in.\n\n  Here is the proposed plan:\n\n\n   1. Step 1: Basic File Interaction (Without Checkpointing)\n       * Goal: To understand how I read and modify files in the most direct way.\n       * Action: We'll start with a simple task. I'll have you ask me to create a new file, plan.md, and write this very plan into it. This will demonstrate the\n         basic write_file tool without any safety nets, as you requested.\n\n\n   2. Step 2: Introducing Checkpointing\n       * Goal: To see the safety net of checkpointing in action and learn how to revert changes.\n       * Action: First, I'll guide you on how to enable checkpointing. Then, we'll perform another modification on plan.md. After I've made the change, I'll show\n         you how to use the /restore command to instantly undo it, demonstrating the value of this feature.\n\n\n   3. Step 3: Building a Simple Program\n       * Goal: To move from simple file edits to a realistic software development task.\n       * Action: We will build a small, functional command-line application. A great starter project would be a TODO list manager. It would be a simple script (we\n         can use Python or Node.js) that can add tasks to a file, list them, and remove them. I will write the code and create the necessary files, and you will\n         guide the process.\n\n\n   4. Step 4: Writing Tests\n       * Goal: To demonstrate a more complete development workflow that includes quality assurance.\n       * Action: Once the basic TODO list manager is working, I will write unit tests for it. This will show how I can help maintain code quality by creating\n         tests that verify the program's functionality, following the conventions of this project.\n\n  This structured approach will allow us to cover file manipulation, safety features, code generation, and testing in a practical way.\n\n\n  Does this plan sound good to you? If so, we can begin with Step 1: creating the plan.md file.\n\nUsing 2 GEMINI.md files\n", "numLines": 100, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 100}}, "debug_event_type": "posttool"}

Let's create a design doc just for tagging alone, I wanna know what people do in user interfaces when it involves tagging.\n\nOK, what's create another document called backlog I want to place the template and structures mention in the `feature\u2013design.md` in there, please. \n\nGoing forward, we're going to use the `backlog.md` file for all things that we wanna plan later. speaking about that let's place the backend in that file.\n\nI like the idea on quick capture so the very first thing that should happen when you open the app should be that it will open up a new entry space so that the user can store information.   there needs to be a quick button to search, but that is the primary goal.\n\nAlso, when the application is not being used, but in the background of the mobile phone after 15 minutes when it is reopened or  resuming or reactivating the application then I wanted to immediately go to the page to store information.\n\n let's outline the set of pages that will be in this application\n 1. store information\n 2. information page\n 3. list information page\n\nI don't see any other pages that we want to add to this application.\n\nPlease update the plan.MD file as necessary with the information that you're receiving. Please add this to the workflow. \n\nLet's add to the backlog import bulk information. And exporting information.\n\nAlso, let's create a design dock and what the data schema will look like for this application. There might be multiple data schema so let's consider that as well.\n\nLet's put smart suggestions in the backlog as well. That seems like a very complex part of the application.\n\nLet's put collaboration preparation in the backlog as well.\n\nLet's create a set of components that we will want to utilize in the application as well. Let's put that in the `components.md` file.  please add this to the workflow. \n\nI want to design doc on using flutter or react native so let's place all the information on that in there like I said, I wanna list of UI libraries for each one so I can see which ones I want select don't include pros and cons. I just want links in there.\n\nLet's create a to do list for planning `planning-todo.md` so that I can keep track of all the suggestions that you provided, and that we can mark them down. Remember that to do list need to be checked like `- [ ] <todo item>` and when completed marked by `- [\u2705]`. Please include this in the `workflow.md`.\n\n\n\n", "numLines": 42, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 42}}, "debug_event_type": "posttool"}

Given your background, this could be a small CLI tool, a basic web API, a script to automate a system\n          admin task, or a simple data processing pipeline.\n       2.

You will describe the core functionality of the application in plain English.\n       2. I will write the initial boilerplate and core logic using write_file, explaining the code I've generated.\n\n\n  Step 3: Iterative Development & Increasing Scope\n   * Goal: Continuously add features and complexity to our project.\n   * Our Actions: This will be our main loop.\n       1.

I will analyze the existing code (read_file, glob), implement the feature (replace, write_file), and run any necessary checks like linters or tests\n          (run_shell_command).\n\n\n  Step 4: Tool Integration & Automation\n   * Goal: Use my full capabilities to automate development tasks.\n   * Our Actions:\n       1. As we work, we will identify opportunities for automation.\n       2. You can ask me to perform tasks like: \"Search the codebase for all instances of this variable,\" \"Write a script to automatically format all code,\" or\n          \"Read the documentation for this library and explain how to use it.\"\n\n  ---\n\n\n  This plan allows us to start immediately and build momentum. The focus is on a practical, hands-on partnership.\n\n  Let's begin with Step 1.\n\n  What simple project would you like to build first? To get the ideas flowing, here are a few examples based on your experience:\n\n\n   * A CLI tool: Maybe a tool that renames files in a directory based on a pattern, or one that fetches weather information from a public API.\n   * A simple API: A backend service with one or two endpoints, for example, a URL shortener.\n   * A sysadmin script: A script that checks the disk space on your machine and sends a notification if it's low.\n\n\n  What do you think? What should we build?\n\n\n", "numLines": 51, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 51}}, "debug_event_type": "posttool"}

I think this is specific to the application though.\n- [ ] it only creates research folders when using the `#research` command.\n- [ ] the AI is working in multiple projects. Not one\n\n### Changes to Problems\n- [x] it did not write anything in the `learnings.md` file either.\n- [x] It wrote the code in the `tick_tac_toe` folder, not `Jakes_project/tick_tac_toe`.\n\n### Suggestions\n- provide it with instructions on how to find and eliminate errors or syntax errors or compile issues in the code.\n- learn how to use a mcp sever, especially one \n- see if it will take a list of urls and search them all..\n- tell it to create a commit, for every todo in the todo list.\n- tell it to refine the todo list, so that there are smaller sets of todos.\n\t- Need a way to organize, priorize, and rank the todo list, especially based off dependencies.\n- triage the items in the learnings.md so that we can learn from them and create solutions for them. \n- have a `plan-todo.md` so that we can create a todo for the plan...\n- get rid of it's it cant be done mentality. `doing the same things again and again` and expecting different results. needs to listen and do what I say.\n- todos need to have the main objective.  This can also be in the plan as well.\n- have a look at later file, a file that has a list of things I want to look at later.   \n- I need to enforce it to restructure the todo list, into organized chunks. \n- I need to enforce it to digest and create smaller sized todos in the todo list.\n\t- maybe make it size it to\n- need to restrict the usage of `go get`\n- need to research persmission and controls in claude code as well.\n- we need to add tools, so that it can find todos `grep \"- \\[ \\]\"`\n- we need it to complete one step at a time in the `todo.md`.\n- for UIs it is best to make them design it, or create an image and then have them somehow get an image produced from the code itself.\n- How can I get multiple agents to work on the same project during the planning step of the application?\n- ask it to create a dependency graph, based off the `plan.md` file\n- before it creates the `todo.md` file make sure that it re-reads the design docs for information about the application, then reference the `plan.md` to generate the `todo.md` list.\n", "numLines": 39, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 39}}, "debug_event_type": "posttool"}
