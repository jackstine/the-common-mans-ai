## Serena
[serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena)
Serena provides language servers, which is great for Claude, so that it can search your code base most effectively, just like how Visual Studio does.  This is like Crack for Claude. If you have dealt with neovim, you already know what I mean.

- language server capabilities
- provides context about the project

## Context7
[context7](https://context7.com/)
Documentation for your agents.  Feed them with knowledge, so that they do better at the thing you want them to work on. Need info about flutter (you got it), need to know about `kubectl`(it's there), etc.

## Playwright
[playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)
Use this for building UIs,  and making end to end tests for claude.

## Sequential Thinking
[sequential thinking](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking)
Helps the agent break down steps into smaller concrete steps, instead of abstract loose large steps. Useful for projects that you are just begining and you have a large todo or draft on the PRD (product Requirements Document)
