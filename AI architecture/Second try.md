  I've reviewed the documentation you provided. To best help you create a plan for using Gemini, I need to understand your goals and workflow. Based on the
  documentation, here are a few questions to get us started:

   1. First, what is the main thing you hope to accomplish with me? Are you looking to use me for software development (like writing or refactoring code),
      automating tasks (like managing files or running scripts), analyzing data, or something else entirely?


   2. Could you tell me a bit about the types of projects you work on? For example, what programming languages do you use most often?


   3. The documentation outlines several ways to authenticate, which impact cost, quotas, and data privacy. How do you plan to authenticate? Are you using a
      personal Google account, a company/workspace account, or do you plan to use an API key from Google AI Studio or Vertex AI?

   4. I can be extended with custom tools to interact with services like GitHub. Is connecting to other services or creating your own custom tools something you're
      interested in exploring?


   5. Finally, I include safety features like sandboxing (to isolate commands and file edits) and checkpointing (to revert changes). How important are these
      features for your workflow?

✦ Excellent, thank you, Jake. That gives me a clear picture of your experience and what you want to achieve. It's great that you want to start with a foundational
  understanding and build from there.

  Based on your goals, I've created a plan for us. The idea is to start with the fundamentals of how I interact with your project and then progressively build up
  to a complete development task, incorporating the features you're interested in.

  Here is the proposed plan:


   1. Step 1: Basic File Interaction (Without Checkpointing)
       * Goal: To understand how I read and modify files in the most direct way.
       * Action: We'll start with a simple task. I'll have you ask me to create a new file, plan.md, and write this very plan into it. This will demonstrate the
         basic write_file tool without any safety nets, as you requested.


   2. Step 2: Introducing Checkpointing
       * Goal: To see the safety net of checkpointing in action and learn how to revert changes.
       * Action: First, I'll guide you on how to enable checkpointing. Then, we'll perform another modification on plan.md. After I've made the change, I'll show
         you how to use the /restore command to instantly undo it, demonstrating the value of this feature.


   3. Step 3: Building a Simple Program
       * Goal: To move from simple file edits to a realistic software development task.
       * Action: We will build a small, functional command-line application. A great starter project would be a TODO list manager. It would be a simple script (we
         can use Python or Node.js) that can add tasks to a file, list them, and remove them. I will write the code and create the necessary files, and you will
         guide the process.


   4. Step 4: Writing Tests
       * Goal: To demonstrate a more complete development workflow that includes quality assurance.
       * Action: Once the basic TODO list manager is working, I will write unit tests for it. This will show how I can help maintain code quality by creating
         tests that verify the program's functionality, following the conventions of this project.

  This structured approach will allow us to cover file manipulation, safety features, code generation, and testing in a practical way.


  Does this plan sound good to you? If so, we can begin with Step 1: creating the plan.md file.
