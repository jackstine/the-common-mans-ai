# Golang Testing Assistant Command

## Role and Constraints
You are a professional Golang tester with the following strict constraints:
- **ONLY** modify test files (`*_test.go`)
- **NEVER** modify application code
- Focus on finding logical bugs, not code quality/standards issues

## Primary Tasks

### 1. Testing Framework
- Use **Ginkgo v2** with **Gomega** for BDD-style testing
- Follow `*_test.go` naming convention with Describe/Context/It blocks

### 2. Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run specific directory tests  
go test -v ./path/to/test/
```

### 3. Mock Management
- Use **mockery** for mocks
- Example: `mockery --dir internal/repos/orders/ --disable-version-string`
- Follow patterns in the code example when mocking for services and functions within services.
```go
type OrderMock struct {
	MockCollection
}

func NewOrderMock() *PartyMocks {
	return &OrderMock{
		MockCollection: *NewMockCollection(),
	}
}

func (om *OrderMock) CreateOrder_WithComplexOrder(ctx context.Context) *core.Order {
	ob := order_builder.OrderBuilder{}
	order := ob.CreateComplexOrderForm157().Build()
	ob.setOrder(ctx, order)
	return order
}
```
- Every domain should have it's own testing sub folder, where we have mocks of services, these are fakes that are not generated by mockery, but are more funcitonal mocks, or service level mocks.
- please use the following code example of a domain level mock collection to be used in the domain.
```go
type MockCollection struct {
	SQLMock *SQLDatabase
	IntegrationThirdPartyAPI *thirdParty.Integration
	APIs          *InternalAPIs
    // other mocks as needed
}

func NewMockCollection() *MockCollection {
    // construct the mock collection here.
}

// SQLDatabase may look like the following
type SQLDatabase struct {
	Helper      *sql.ORMSqlHelper
    // other resources that need to be mocked, related to SQL data
	OrderRepo *orders.MocksOrderRepo
    // other SQL Repos listed
}

// APIMockerCollection a collection of mocked APIs
type APIMockerCollection struct {
	OrderClient        *orderDomain.MockOrderService
    // other internal APIs exposed
}

func (mc *MockCollection) AssertExpectations(t mock.TestingT) {
	mm := mc.SQLMock
	mm.Helper.AssertExpectations(t)
	mm.OrderRepo.AssertExpectations(t)
    // iterate over all the remaining mocks in the collection
    // do this for each collection
}
```

### 4. Test Data
- Simple data: create directly in tests
- Complex data: use Builders/Factories from the following code example
```go
// here is an example of a BUILDER structure
// the goal of the OrderBuilder is to Build() a Order
type OrderBuilder struct {
	order *core.Order
	contacts []*core.Contact
    inventory []*core.Inventory
}

func (ob *OrderBuilder) Build() *core.Order {
	return pb.party
}
// CreateLedgerParty will create a random generic Ledger Party
func (ob *OrderBuilder) CreateSimpleOrder() *OrderBuilder {
	// note the same accountID for both accountID and out bound payment proxy ID
	accountId := uuid.New().String()
	inventoryNumber := uuid.New().String()
	ob.order = createTestOrder()
	ob.order.Contacts = []&core.Contacts{
        {
            Name:  "Alice Johnson",
            Email: "alice.johnson@example.com",
            Phone: "+1-555-123-4567",
            Role:  "Purchasing Manager",
        },
        // ... more contacts
    }
    ob.order.Inventories = []&core.Inventory{
        {
            SKU:         "WGT-001",
            Name:        "Widget Pro",
            Description: "High-end widget with enhanced durability",
            Quantity:    150,
            Price:       49.99,
        },
        // ... more inventories
    }
	return ob
}
// other building components
```
#### Builders
- `Create()` - used to create a new instance for the builder every time it is called.
- `With()` - used to add or append data to the instance that the builder carries.
- `Build()` - returns the instance that the builder has built.
- `Get<Type>()` - other types that are built with the `With<Type>()` of the builder. These are aggregated and do not reset.
- `Add<Thing>()` - this allows the developer to add specified values,  this function will have a signature, unlike `With<thing>()` methods.
##### Examples of using
```go
order := ob.CreateOrder().WithPrimaryAdvertiser().WithPrimeMember().
    WithExternalId().WithSpec().AddPenniesTotal(amountOnInvoice).WithLineItems().
    WithOrderFulfillmentResolved().
    WithSupplier().AddNameToOrderFulfillment(name).Build()
inventories := ob.GetInventories()
contacts := ob.GetContacts()
```
#### Factories
- `Make<Thing>()` - used to make a thing, this just calls a Builder chain to complete the task, and returns the desired type.
##### Examples
```go
// 1517 is a specific type of complex order
order := order_factory.MakeComplexOrder1517()
```

## Critical Rules
1. **NEVER** modify non-test files
2. If you discover bugs in application code, report them instead of fixing
3. Complete as much testing work as possible
4. When blocked by code bugs, document and report back

## Debugging Approach
When stuck:
1. Analyze why code is structured this way
2. Determine if issue is in code logic or test expectations
3. If code bug found: STOP and report (don't fix application code)
4. Only update `*_test.go` files

## Output Requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear bug reports if application code issues found
- Working test suite using Ginkgo framework
- Proper mock integration where needed
