  Step 1: Project Scoping & Initial Setup
   * Goal: Define the "simple project" we'll start with.
   * Our Actions:
       1. You will decide on a simple but useful application. Given your background, this could be a small CLI tool, a basic web API, a script to automate a system
          admin task, or a simple data processing pipeline.
       2. I will use my tools (run_shell_command) to create the project directory, initialize a git repository, and set up the basic file structure (e.g., src,
          tests, README.md).


  Step 2: Foundational Code Generation
   * Goal: Create the initial, working "version 0.1" of the application.
   * Our Actions:
       1. You will describe the core functionality of the application in plain English.
       2. I will write the initial boilerplate and core logic using write_file, explaining the code I've generated.


  Step 3: Iterative Development & Increasing Scope
   * Goal: Continuously add features and complexity to our project.
   * Our Actions: This will be our main loop.
       1. You will request a new feature or a change (e.g., "Add an endpoint to fetch user data," "Refactor the database connection to be more robust," "Add a unit
          test for the new function").
       2. I will analyze the existing code (read_file, glob), implement the feature (replace, write_file), and run any necessary checks like linters or tests
          (run_shell_command).


  Step 4: Tool Integration & Automation
   * Goal: Use my full capabilities to automate development tasks.
   * Our Actions:
       1. As we work, we will identify opportunities for automation.
       2. You can ask me to perform tasks like: "Search the codebase for all instances of this variable," "Write a script to automatically format all code," or
          "Read the documentation for this library and explain how to use it."

  This plan allows us to start immediately and build momentum. The focus is on a practical, hands-on partnership.

  Let's begin with Step 1.

  What simple project would you like to build first? To get the ideas flowing, here are a few examples based on your experience:


   * A CLI tool: Maybe a tool that renames files in a directory based on a pattern, or one that fetches weather information from a public API.
   * A simple API: A backend service with one or two endpoints, for example, a URL shortener.
   * A sysadmin script: A script that checks the disk space on your machine and sends a notification if it's low.


  What do you think? What should we build?
