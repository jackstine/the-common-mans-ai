# AI Playing - Claude Code Experimentation

This repository contains Jake's exploration and experimentation with Claude Code, documenting workflows, prompting techniques, and AI-assisted development strategies. The project includes a comprehensive talk outline covering Claude Code fundamentals, prompting best practices (Chain of Thought, Few Shot, Tree of Thought), and practical implementation approaches. It features detailed documentation on AI agent workflows, project scoping methodologies, and architectural considerations for building applications with AI assistance. The repository demonstrates real-world AI development patterns including todo management, iterative development cycles, and cost optimization strategies for AI-powered development workflows. Additionally, it contains experimental work on mobile application development using AI agents, focusing on tagging systems, offline-first design, and user interface planning. This serves as both a learning resource and a practical guide for developers interested in integrating AI tools into their development process.
