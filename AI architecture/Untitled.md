i like nodes, that could be used with tags I see that has a potential for the application, but I guess I'm thinking and programming terms like a map. 

I don't wanna have full text search I want to be based off tags.

In fact, let's just create this application to be off-line in the first phase.

I want to focus and plan on the tagging portion of the application. Let's create a design doc just for tagging alone, I wanna know what people do in user interfaces when it involves tagging.

OK, what's create another document called backlog I want to place the template and structures mention in the `feature–design.md` in there, please. 

Going forward, we're going to use the `backlog.md` file for all things that we wanna plan later. speaking about that let's place the backend in that file.

I like the idea on quick capture so the very first thing that should happen when you open the app should be that it will open up a new entry space so that the user can store information.   there needs to be a quick button to search, but that is the primary goal.

Also, when the application is not being used, but in the background of the mobile phone after 15 minutes when it is reopened or  resuming or reactivating the application then I wanted to immediately go to the page to store information.

 let's outline the set of pages that will be in this application
 1. store information
 2. information page
 3. list information page

I don't see any other pages that we want to add to this application.

Please update the plan.MD file as necessary with the information that you're receiving. Please add this to the workflow. 

Let's add to the backlog import bulk information. And exporting information.

Also, let's create a design dock and what the data schema will look like for this application. There might be multiple data schema so let's consider that as well.

Let's put smart suggestions in the backlog as well. That seems like a very complex part of the application.

Let's put collaboration preparation in the backlog as well.

Let's create a set of components that we will want to utilize in the application as well. Let's put that in the `components.md` file.  please add this to the workflow. 

I want to design doc on using flutter or react native so let's place all the information on that in there like I said, I wanna list of UI libraries for each one so I can see which ones I want select don't include pros and cons. I just want links in there.

Let's create a to do list for planning `planning-todo.md` so that I can keep track of all the suggestions that you provided, and that we can mark them down. Remember that to do list need to be checked like `- [ ] <todo item>` and when completed marked by `- [✅]`. Please include this in the `workflow.md`.
